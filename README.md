## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
-   npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Fitpro-main
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
